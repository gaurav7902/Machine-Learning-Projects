# Machine-Learning-Projects
I am deeply passionate about learning Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML). Despite having no prior experience with Python coding and limited time, Iâ€™ve managed to complete a few projects to get a foundational understanding. However, I am eager to expand my knowledge and skill set in these fields. Being highly motivated and genuinely interested in AI and ML, I believe joining the AI/ML club will provide me with the opportunity to learn from others and contribute. I am committed to putting in my best effort and would greatly appreciate the chance to further develop my expertise with the support of the club.Please consider my genuine interest.
Thanking you!
